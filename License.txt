General Information
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The BIM software registers point clouds to CAD models. It includes automatic registration algorithms. It is useful in cases where complex shapes are inspected by laser scanners. Sample cloud points and models are provided with the software.
The BIM software was developed at the NSF Engineering Research Center for Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (ERC/RMS) at the University of Michigan.
This is the version from 20 November 2005. The development team at the time was: Xinju Li, Jacob Barhak, Igor Guskov, Geoffrey W. Blake. The software was developed for a while by multiple people and not well documented. Also some time has passed since it was last compiled, so recompiling it may take an effort.

Example Data
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The models under the Data directory were manufactured and scanned. The data includes the model file that was manufactured and the scanned data. There are no restrictions for releasing this data.

The Turbine Blade model and Stanford Bunny were obtained from the Large Geometric Models Archive at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The web site is:

http://www.cc.gatech.edu/projects/large_models/

Here is text from this web site:

The purpose of this site is to provide large models to researchers in computer graphics and related fields. There are thousands of geometric models available on the Web, yet the vast majority of them are small and thus do not provide an adequate challenge to the creators of new geometric algorithms and techniques. Very large models are a challenge to techniques for rendering, automatic simplification, geometry compression, visibility techniques, surface reconstruction and surface fitting. In the Digital Age there are many sources of very large geometric datasets, yet many researchers do not have access to such data. This website is an attempt to remedy this situation.
